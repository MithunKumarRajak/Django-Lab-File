# Step about the model and admin panel also CRUD operation

You’ve got **most of the core idea right**

1. **App creation** – ✔️ Correct

   * You first create a Django app (e.g., `python manage.py startapp myapp`).

2. **models.py schema** – ✔️ Correct

   * Inside `myapp/models.py`, you define model classes (tables in DB).

3. **Register in admin.py** – ✔️ Partially Correct

   * Registering in `admin.py` is only **needed if you want to manage the model in Django Admin Panel**.
   * Models work even without admin registration; it’s just for the GUI.

4. **CRUD operations → Django shell** – ⚠️ Partially Correct

   * Yes, you *can* perform CRUD using the Django shell (`python manage.py shell`) by importing models.
   * But **you don’t have to**.
   * CRUD is usually done through:

     * **Views + Templates** (standard web pages)
     * **Django Admin** (if registered)
     * **Django REST Framework** (for APIs)

# Typical Workflow

1️⃣ Create app → `startapp`
2️⃣ Define models → `models.py`
3️⃣ **Apply migrations**

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

✅ This step is **essential** to create tables in DB.
4️⃣ Register in `admin.py` (optional for Admin UI)
5️⃣ Use:

* **Django Shell** for quick testing (`from myapp.models import ModelName`)
* **Views/Templates** for web CRUD
* **Admin Panel** for easy data management
